Keechma Forms library allows you to build forms (using the Reagent library) that have a great UX. It implements the following features:

- Validation system that can validate nested data of arbitrary depth
- Dirty fields tracking - so you can show only the relevant errors to the user

Keechma Forms library is agnostic to your UI code, so you can use it with any Reagent UI library (like [Reagent Forms](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-forms)).

**Keechma Forms is not coupled with the rest of the Keechma ecosystem and can be used in any Reagent based application.**
